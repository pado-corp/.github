## 🐧 About The Plato

[The Origin of the name](https://blog.yeoul.io/2024/03/30/platonic-fold.html)
1. **Reflection** - We move forward even if we face rejection in the market.
2. **Refraction** - Like a wave propagating in the shortest time, we always maintain a lean attitude.
3. **Diffraction** - We continuously move forward based on flexible thinking.
4. **Interference** - We're a team that generates maximum synergy when all members come together.

## 📌 Our Core Values
